# ENV

In this repository I collect scripts and settings for my development environment. I tend to switch between using linux and Mac OS every once in a while so I keep this README as a memorandum to myself. The main goal is that this README should contain complete instructions for setting up my environment exactly how I want it.

Feel free to use any of this if you find it useful but do it at your own risk! :)

## Keys

You can setup new GPG and SSH keys or transfer the current ones from an old system. Just make sure that the public keys are setup on GitHub and other places (like servers) that you need to access.

### GPG

The GPG key is used to sign git commits and should be tied to `dev@ilix.se`.

```shell
# Generate a new key to use when signing git commits.
gpg --full-generate-key

# Export public key and add it to GitHub and other relevant places.
gpg --output ~/public.gpg --armor --export dev@ilix.se
cat ~/public.gpg
```

### SSH

```shell
# Create a new rsa key to use with git
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Export public key and add it to GitHub and other relevant places.
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

## Environment

### Shell (bash)

```bash
# Add this to `~/.bash_profile` to ensure that `~/.bashrc` is loaded.
if [ -r ~/.bashrc ]; then
   source ~/.bashrc
fi
```

**NOTE** If you are on Mac OS run `chsh -s /bin/bash` to change your default shell to bash.

### .bashrc

Clone the repo and load up the bash profile.

```shell
# Clone the .env repo
git clone git@github.com:alexanderczigler/.env.git ~/.env

# Install .bashrc
cp ~/.env/.bashrc ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**NOTE:** Whenever you make changes to .bashrc, run `bup` to refresh it.

### GIT

```shell
# Get the gpg key id.
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

# Configure git, replace <keyid> with the id from the command above.
cat >~/.gitconfig << EOL
[user]
  signingkey = <keyid>
  name = Alexander Czigler
  email = dev@ilix.se
[init]
  defaultBranch = main
[commit]
  gpgsign = true
EOL
```

### Tools

#### Homebrew

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) then use it to install the following packages.

```bash
brew install awscli bash-completion direnv doctl eksctl gnupg2 helm kubectl kubectx nvm pinentry-mac skaffold watch

# FiraCode font
# https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Installing
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-fira-code
```

##### GnuPG + pinentry

GnuPG needs to be configured to use pinentry-mac

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gnupg
echo "pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac" > ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
```

#### iTerm

1. Install [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/).
2. Configure the main iTerm profile as a hotkey window triggered by **ยง**.
3. Configure iTerm to launch when loggin in (hidden).
4. Fix keybinds in iTerm: [Jumping between words in iTerm](https://coderwall.com/p/h6yfda/use-and-to-jump-forwards-backwards-words-in-iterm-2-on-os-x).
5. Map Shift + Insert keybind in iTerm to "Paste...".

### Other

- Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/linux/install/archlinux/)

#### Using a regular mouse in Mac OS

When using a regular mouse I want the scroll wheel to behave like I am used to. So I use [UnnaturalScrollWheels](https://github.com/ther0n/UnnaturalScrollWheels) to keep mouse and trackpad scrolling settings opposite of each other. Install and configure it to launch on login.

```bash
brew install --cask unnaturalscrollwheels
```

After that, install [SensibleSideButtons](https://sensible-side-buttons.archagon.net) and also configure it to launch on login.
